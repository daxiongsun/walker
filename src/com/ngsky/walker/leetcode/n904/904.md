# 904. Fruit Into Baskets
Medium

In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].

You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:

    Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
    Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.

Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.

You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.

What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].

Example 2:

Input: [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].

Example 3:

Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].

Example 4:

Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.

 

Note:

    1 <= tree.length <= 40000
    0 <= tree[i] < tree.length

# 解题思路
1.从位置0开始选择水果，并将水果放入A果蓝中，再遍历后续果树，如果类型和A相同则放入A中，不同则放入B果蓝中，以A和B都不相同时，结束当前起始选择方法。开启新的初始化选择。
2.当整棵树都被挑选过时，结束所有方案。
3.优化：如果当前初始化选择类型 和 上一次初始化选择类型 相同，那么直接跳过 [减枝]
